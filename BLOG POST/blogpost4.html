        <h5 class="color">Step 1: Choose Your Flowers and Container <h5 class="DETAIL3">Select a variety of flowers that complement each other in color and texture. Consider the size of the blooms in relation to your container to ensure a balanced look. Popular choices include roses for elegance, daisies for a casual look, and lilies for dramatic flair. For the container, anything from a traditional vase to a more creative holder like a mason jar or an antique teapot will work. </h5>

        <h5 class="color">Step 2: Prepare Your Materials<h5 class="DETAIL4"> Before arranging, prepare your flowers by trimming the stems at an angle to allow them to absorb water more efficiently. Remove any leaves that would be below the waterline to prevent bacterial growth. If you're using floral foam, soak it in water until it's fully saturated to help extend the life of your flowers.</h5>

        <h5 class="color">Step 3: Arrange Your Flowers:<h5 class="DETAIL5">Start with the larger flowers to form the base of your arrangement, then add smaller flowers and fillers like baby's breath or ferns to fill in gaps and add texture. Experiment with height and depth by placing some blooms a bit higher or lower than others. For a cohesive look, turn the arrangement as you work to ensure it looks good from all angles.  </h5>
